NikkyBot is an IRC chatbot that primarily attempts to imitate Nikky Southerland
on EFNet.  It works via a hybrid of pattern/reply lookup tables with a Python-
written engine inspired by AIML and Markov chaining, with some occasional
custom Python code sprinkled around for special cases.

Usage
-----

In public channels, speak to the chatbot by including its nickname in your line
(i.e., highlight it).  It will also respond to private messages/queries; it is
not necessary to highlight it in this case.


Commands/special features
-------------------------

personas
personalities

Get a URL to a list of available Markov personalities (used for “mimic” and
“botchat”, explained below).


mimic [<personality>|someone [<message>]]

Say a line imitating <personality> using the NikkyBot engine, replying to
optional <message>.  “someone” can be used to select a random personality.
If no arguments are given, a random personality will be mimicked with a random
message.

Examples:
mimic tev
mimic kerm Hi, KermM!
mimic someone
mimic someone TI-89
mimic


botchat <personality1> <personality2>

Generates a “conversation” between two NikkyBot engines, using the given
personalities.  This may take a few to several minutes.  NikkyBot will then
provide a link to the Pastebinned transcript.

Example:
botchat nikky netham45


don't highlight me

Causes NikkyBot to attempt to avoid highlighting your current nick when it
mentions it.  This command will need to be repeated if your nick changes.


highlight me

Undoes the effect of “don't highlight me”.  NikkyBot will speak your current
nick normally again.
